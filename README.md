## <p align=center> <span style="color:orange"> About Us </span> 


<p align=center> My name is William Hawke and I'm a solo independent games developer from lincoln. I am focused on creating cheap, fun, add free PC games that do not harvest data. I am also commited to not including any paid for lootboxes or DLC. Everything in the games I make can be unlocked or collected by playing. Unfortunatly I suffer from severe mental health problems and I use programing as a method of coping with my anxiety and bi polar.
